# Iowans for Better Voting

<u><strong>The government is not representing us.<strong/><u/>

...and RANK CHOICE VOTING could help change that!

&nbsp;

**This association exists to help our collective views directly affect our local leaders!**


Lets shift the Overton Window with
- better Voting Systems
- better Party Systems
- better Parties
- better Candidates
- better Candidate Info
- i.e... **BETTER VOTING!**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## FIRST ON THE DOCKET: REPEAL HOUSE FILE 954!

- [House File 954](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&ba=HF%20954)
   - HF954 pre-emptively and EXPLICITLY bans Rank Choice Voting by name
   - signed into law by Governor Kim Reynolds in June 2025.
- Iowa Governor
   - Since Kim Reynolds ain't running for re-election, we'll have even more of a chance of electing a governor who'll actually be in favor of the people & let HF954 be repealed!
   - [Rob Sand]([url](https://robsand.com/) (the current State Auditor, and only currently-elected Democrat in the state) seems to be not even just the best choice we've got, but a good one!
   - Right now, we can [petition to secure Rob Sand's place on the ballot](https://robsand.com/petition/),
   - and make sure to vote in the gubernatorial primaries JUNE 2ND 2026! (<t:1780401600:R>)
   - and in the actual gubernatorial election NOVEMBER 3RD 2026 of course! (<t:1793710800:R>)
- Iowa Congress
   - What we'll also need is the support of the Iowa state legislators, whom you can find [here](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find) by simply typing in your zip code.

#### ALSO ON THE DOCKET: GET MORE MEMBERS!
