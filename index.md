# Iowans for Better Voting

<u>**Hello! Here in Iowa, we need:**<u/>
- better Voting Systems
- better Candidates
- better Candidate Information
- better Parties
- better Ballots
- i.e... **BETTER VOTING!**

**This association exists to collect ideas and show that there are people who believe in them!**

&nbsp;

IN CONSTRUCTION; REST OF TEMPLATE [HERE](./template.html)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

TO-DO:
- set this site up sommore
  - integrate Google Forms (input)
  - integrate Google Sheets (output)
  - change to a custom domain name if possible
  - create "Actions" category to store what we're currently working on
    - like I'm imagining this would hold PDFs of proposals/petitions to local govt for ranked choice voting, etc
    - would also include a "Completed" category ofc
  - set up meter at bottom of screen showing funding, i.e. reach this & we can keep this site online with custom domain (assuming thatll cost us), reach this & we can apply for whatever applications have costs attached to em, etc 
- define Tenets
- define "Board of Directors" i.e. founding staff/members of IBV
- look into [this advice](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/how-do-i-register-a-non-profit-organization-in-iowa) for registering a non-profit org
- find more things to put on this to-do list
- always be fully transparent
