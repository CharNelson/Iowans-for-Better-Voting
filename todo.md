TO-DO:
- set this site up sommore
  - ~~integrate Google Forms (input)~~
  - ~~integrate Google Sheets (output)~~
  - change to a custom domain name if possible
    - this will indeed most likely cost money & require like DNS shenanigans but we'll figure that out
    - ALSO custom domain probably means actually deciding FOR REAL what the name of this association/organization should be
  - create "Actions" category to store what we're currently working on
    - like I'm imagining this would hold PDFs of proposals/petitions to local govt for ranked choice voting, etc
    - would also include a "Completed" category ofc
  - set up meter at bottom of screen showing funding, i.e. reach this & we can keep this site online with custom domain (assuming thatll cost us (yep)), reach this & we can apply for whatever applications have costs attached to em, etc
  - Analytics ?

    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/how-to-add-google-analytics-to-github-pages/
- DATA IN & DATA OUT
  - make more Google Forms for folks to fill out
    - ~~create membership form!~~
  - would be nice to be able to have a link from Google Form immediately to resulting data; could insert that manually into "Your submission has been received" message 
  - perhaps this input/output stuff needs its own page(s) idk
    - embeds are nice & cool but they take up more space than just line after line of hyperlinks but also the latter sounds daunting
  - make sure to not use Google Forms for sensitive info tho; folks can apparently perhaps get into full Google Sheet from just embedded data view; already not collecting emails unless freely given but like yknow
- define Tenets
- define "Board of Directors" i.e. founding staff/members of IBV
- look into [this advice](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/how-do-i-register-a-non-profit-organization-in-iowa) for registering a non-profit org
- find more things to put on this to-do list
- stay fully transparent
